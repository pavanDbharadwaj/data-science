NAIVE BAYES

NAIVE--> ASSUMPTION -->FEATURES ARE INDEPENDENT
BAYES--> FORMULA USED

-> IT IS A SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHM WHICH IS USED FOR CLASSIFICATION BASED SCENARIO

WHEN TO USE NAIVE BAYES

-> USED FOR TEXT BASED DATASET

-> SMALL-MEDIUM DATASETS

-> ALSO FOR LARGER DATASETS BY TUNING VECTORIZER 

-> WE CAN USE FOR MULTI CLASS LABELS CLASSIFICATION SCENARIO


FORMULA:-

P(Y|X) = (P(X|Y)/P(X)) * P(Y)


WHEN NOT TO USE NAIVE BAYES:

-->NOISY DATASET,NON LINEAR PATTERN,RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEATURES

TYPES OF NAIVE BAYES:

-->BERNOUILE NAIVE BAYES-->BINARY VALUES 
-->GAUSSIAN NAIVE BAYES--> CONTINEOUS VALUES VALUES
-->MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES-->MULTIPLE CLASS LABELS AND COMPLETELY SENTAENCED BASED
